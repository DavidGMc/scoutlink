# ScoutLink IRC App for Android

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to provide a zero (or minimal) configuration app which connects directly to the ScoutLink IRC network, without requiring any knowledge of
the workings of IRC, server addresses, and so on. It also only allows connection to ScoutLink and no other IRC network, meaning it can safely be installed on younger
Scout's devices without the risk of them being able to connect to other IRC networks.

## Contributing
I am open to contributions to the project however beyond simple changes I would appreciate a heads up before starting the work, as I may be working on a large feature
could lead to merge conflicts and general sadness.

## Discussion
I can be found at fordy [AT] scoutlink [DOT] net, via GitHub issues, the [ScoutLink discourse page](https://discourse.scoutlink.net), or occasionally on IRC. I work on
this project in my spare time (which seems to be increasingly sparse) so please be patient if it takes me a while to get back to you.
